### Operant conditioning:

**Fixed ratio (FR) schedule of reinforcement**

* **FR1**: One lever-press resulted in one pellet delivery.

* **FR5**: Five lever-presses resulted in one pellet delivery.

### Behavioral test (Three addiction-like criteria):

**Persistence to response**: Non-reinforced active responses during the pellet-free period (10 min), when the box was 
illuminated and signaling the unavailability of pellet delivery, were measured as a persistence of food-seeking 
behavior. The corresponding behavioral test is named **self-administration session**. The test take place on the 3 
consecutive days before the progressive ratio mice were scored. Self-administration session takes 1 hour distributed in 
a 25' pellet period, 10' free pellet period and 25' pellet period. The persistence to the response is measured during 
the 10 minutes (free-pellet period).

**Motivation**: The progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement was used to evaluate the motivation for the 
chocolate-flavored pellets. The response required to earn one single pellet escalated according to the following series: 
1, 5, 12, 21, 33, 51, 75, 90, 120, 155, 180, 225, 260, 300, 350, 410, 465, 540, 630, 730, 850, 1000, 1200, 1500, 1800, 
2100, 2400, 2700, 3000, 3400, 3800, 4200, 4600, 5000, and 5500. The maximal number of responses that the animal performs 
to obtain one pellet was the last event completed, referred to as the breaking point. The maximum duration of the 
progressive ratio session was 5 h or until mice did not respond on any lever within 1 h. The test name is the 
**progressive ratio schedule**.

**Compulsivity**: Total number of shocks in the session of shock test (50 min)
performed after the PR test, when each pellet delivered was associated with a punishment, were used to evaluate 
compulsivity-like behavior, previously described as resistance to punishment. Mice were placed in a 
self-administration chamber without the metal sheet with holes and consequently with the grid floor exposed (contextual 
cue). In this shock-session, mice were under a FR5 schedule of reinforcement during 50 min with two scheduled changes: 
at the fourth active lever-response mice received only an electric footshock (0.18 mA, 2 s) without pellet delivery and 
at the fifth active lever-response, mice received another electric footshock with a chocolate-flavored pellet paired 
with the cue light. The schedule was reinitiated after 10 s pellet delivery (time-out period) and after the fourth 
response if mice did not perform the fifth response within a min. Attribution of the three addiction-like criteria: 
After performing the three behavioral tests to measure the food addiction-like behavior, mice were categorized in 
addicted or non-addicted animals depending on the number of positive criteria that they had achieved. An animal was 
considered positive for an addiction-like criterion when the score of the specific behavioral test was above the 75th 
percentile of the normal distribution of the chocolate control group. Mice that achieved two or three addiction-like 
criteria were considered addicted animals and mice that achieved 0 or 1 addiction-like criteria were considered 
non-addicted animals.

They implemented other behavioral tests not used to classify the mice. They named the measures obtained from these tests 
as phenotypic traits:

### Reversal test:

Based in a test used in cocaine addiction testing. A single session where the "meaning" of the levers is exchanged. 
The active becomes the inactive and the inactive becomes active. The levers are placed in the same place just one behind 
the other. Left and right. There is any cue, is just that when they press the previous inactive lever (now active) they
don't get anything. They have to try the new active lever and then they get chocolate and a cue when they do a FR5.  

### Shock test:

Shock in the 4 and 5 response (lever press). Since the mice are used to perform a FR5, now suddeny on the FR4 they get 
a shock. This shock should stop them of pressing the lever again. If they press the lever again the get another shock 
but also a pellet. The very addicted mouse do not care and they measure the number of shocks they receive. This is 
performed this way with a shock on FR4 to make the test more severe since it was developed with cocaine and in the case
of the cocaine needs to be more severe. With food not really, but this way they perform the same paradigm (protocol).  
but they do this way. During this test the floor of the cage is different so that mouse associate a context to the 
an adversive stimulus (this is use the next day, see next point).

*Note: This is the only session where something different is happening in FR4 all the others are FR5*

###  Shock-induced supression test (Post-shock test-adversive learning conditioning):

They put again the same floor that was used in the shock session. This way they can measure the adversive conditioning
of the mice to respect to the shock. With cocaine and rats they use a light as the conditioning stimulus. But mice are
less inteligent and it does not work to use different color lights. Is the contrary to the associative appetitive 
learning with the light.

### Cue-induced food seeking

Is like a version of the reinstatement in a single session. The "long Reinstatment (cue-induced relapse)" consisted of 
several sessions of extinction and single session of relapse. In this case, test consists in 60 minutes of extiction plus 30 minutes of 
relapse (cue-induced reinstatement). It has a light that signals, and they search the light there is not pellet, it is 
only induced by the light (thus cue-induced reinstatement) it is only induced by the light the control that has the 
conditional stimulus on the behavior. In comparison with the cue-induced relapse is very short. This test take place 
after the shock session.

Is a longer protocol than in the previous experiment, 112 days. The **operant conditioning** takes place all along the 
experiment at the beginning with a FR1 schedule and then with a FR5 schedule. At the beginning they assess the 
**learning** with the initial criteria. They assess whether mice have achieved the operant conditioning. This means that 
mice  have a stable behavior and that they can discriminate between the active and inactive lever. To this end, they use 
measures such as the acquisition day, acquisition stability, acquisition discrimination index and number of reinforcers. 
This assessment of the learning takes place just one time at the beginning of the experiment. Then what is repeated in 
the early, mid and late period is the assessment of the addiction criteria or the phenotypics traits of addiction. FR1 is just 
done once, also if they have acquired (acquisition) only at the beginning.
 
Around day 18 the first classification is performed (**early period**). Here they perform primarily the three test of 
the three criteria (**pellet free period**, **motivation with the progresive ratio** and 
**compulsivity with the schock**). The rest of the test are additional (** 

**Impulsivity**: Impulsivity. Number of non-reinforced active lever-presses during three consecutive daily time out 
(10 s) after each pellet delivery. **Does this measure corresponds to the time-out of the FR5 after pellet delivery?**
No corresponde a las sesiones diarias de self-administration.

**Cognitive inflexibility**: ??

**Flexibility**: ??
