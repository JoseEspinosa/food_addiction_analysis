### Operant conditioning:

**Fixed ratio (FR) schedule of reinforcement**

* **FR1**: One lever-press resulted in one pellet delivery.

* **FR5**: Five lever-presses resulted in one pellet delivery.

### Behavioral test (Three addiction-like criteria):

**Persistence to response**: Non-reinforced active responses during the pellet-free period (10 min), when the box was 
illuminated and signaling the unavailability of pellet delivery, were measured as a persistence of food-seeking 
behavior. On the 3 consecutive days before the progressive ratio mice were scored.

**Motivation**: The progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement was used to evaluate the motivation for the 
chocolate-flavored pellets. The response required to earn one single pellet escalated according to the following series: 
1, 5, 12, 21, 33, 51, 75, 90, 120, 155, 180, 225, 260, 300, 350, 410, 465, 540, 630, 730, 850, 1000, 1200, 1500, 1800, 
2100, 2400, 2700, 3000, 3400, 3800, 4200, 4600, 5000, and 5500. The maximal number of responses that the animal performs 
to obtain one pellet was the last event completed, referred to as the breaking point. The maximum duration of the 
progressive ratio session was 5 h or until mice did not respond on any lever within 1 h.

**Compulsivity**: Total number of shocks in the session of shock test (50 min)
performed after the PR test, when each pellet delivered was associated with a punishment, were used to evaluate 
compulsivity-like behavior, previously described as resistance to punishment. Mice were placed in a 
self-administration chamber without the metal sheet with holes and consequently with the grid floor exposed (contextual 
cue). In this shock-session, mice were under a FR5 schedule of reinforcement during 50 min with two scheduled changes: 
at the fourth active lever-response mice received only an electric footshock (0.18 mA, 2 s) without pellet delivery and 
at the fifth active lever-response, mice received another electric footshock with a chocolate-flavored pellet paired 
with the cue light. The schedule was reinitiated after 10 s pellet delivery (time-out period) and after the fourth 
response if mice did not perform the fifth response within a min. Attribution of the three addiction-like criteria: 
After performing the three behavioral tests to measure the food addiction-like behavior, mice were categorized in 
addicted or non-addicted animals depending on the number of positive criteria that they had achieved. An animal was 
considered positive for an addiction-like criterion when the score of the specific behavioral test was above the 75th 
percentile of the normal distribution of the chocolate control group. Mice that achieved two or three addiction-like 
criteria were considered addicted animals and mice that achieved 0 or 1 addiction-like criteria were considered 
non-addicted animals.

Other behavioral measures, not used to classify the mice:

**Impulsivity**: Impulsivity. Number of non-reinforced active lever-presses during three consecutive daily time out 
(10 s) after each pellet delivery. **Does this measure corresponds to the time-out of the FR5 after pellet delivery?**
No corresponde a las sesiones diarias de self-administration.

**Cognitive inflexibility**: ??

**Flexibility**: ??
